```

Welcome to `echarts4r`, let's explore the package together.

1. All functions of the `echarts4r` package start with `e_`.
2. All its [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) proxies end with `_p`. 
3. All `echarts4r` plots are initialised with `e_charts`.
4. All functions are `%>%` friendly.
5. Most functions have escape hatches ending in `_`.

## Your first plot

Let's build a line chart, load the library and pipe your data to `e_charts`. If you are not at ease with the `%>%` you can use `e_charts(mtcars, wt)`.

```{r}
# prepare data
df <- state.x77 %>% 
  as.data.frame() %>% 
  tibble::rownames_to_column("State")
```

```{r}
library(echarts4r) # load echarts4r

df %>% 
  e_charts(x = State) %>% # initialise and set x
  e_line(serie = Population) # add a line
```

If you are not at ease with bare column names you can use the escape hatches ending in `_`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
df %>% 
  e_charts_("State") %>% 
  e_line_("Population")
```

The easiest way is to use the `%>%` operator to add plots and options.

```{r}
df %>% 
  e_charts(State) %>% # initialise and set x
  e_line(Population) %>%  # add a line
  e_area(Income) # add area
```

## Options

We could also change the lines to make them `smooth`.

```{r}
df %>% 
  e_charts(State) %>% # initialise and set x
  e_line(Population, smooth = TRUE) %>%  # add a line
  e_area(Income, smooth = TRUE) # add area
```

`qsec` and `mpg` isn't clear to reader, rename them, lets also label the x axis while we're at it.

```{r}
df %>% 
  e_charts(State) %>% # initialise and set x
  e_line(Population, smooth = TRUE) %>%  # add a line
  e_area(Income, smooth = TRUE) %>%  # add area
  e_x_axis(name = "States") # add x axis name
```

We can use one of the 13 built-in themes, see `?e_theme` for a complete list, we'll also add a title with `e_title`.

```{r}
df %>% 
  e_charts(State) %>% # initialise and set x
  e_line(Population, smooth = TRUE) %>%  # add a line
  e_area(Income, smooth = TRUE) %>%  # add area
  e_x_axis(name = "States") %>%  # add x axis name
  e_title("US States", "Population & Income") %>%  # Add title & subtitle
  e_theme("infographic") # theme
```

The legend and title are a bit close, let's move the legend to another part the canvas.

```{r}
df %>% 
  e_charts(State) %>% # initialise and set x
  e_line(Population, smooth = TRUE) %>%  # add a line
  e_area(Income, smooth = TRUE) %>%  # add area
  e_x_axis(name = "States") %>%  # add x axis name
  e_title("US States", "Population & Income") %>%  # Add title & subtitle
  e_theme("infographic") %>%  # theme
  e_legend(right = 0) # move legend to the bottom
```

Add a tooltip, of which there are numerous [options](https://ecomfe.github.io/echarts-doc/public/en/option.html#tooltip), here we use `trigger = "axis"` to trigger the tooltip by the axis rather than a single data point.

```{r}
df %>% 
  e_charts(State) %>% # initialise and set x
  e_line(Population, smooth = TRUE) %>%  # add a line
  e_area(Income, smooth = TRUE) %>%  # add area
  e_x_axis(name = "States") %>%  # add x axis name
  e_title("US States", "Population & Income") %>%  # Add title & subtitle
  e_theme("infographic") %>%  # theme
  e_legend(right = 0) %>%  # move legend to the bottom
  e_tooltip(trigger = "axis") # tooltip
```

Finally, we are currently plotting population and income on the same axis, let's put them each on their respective y axis by specifying an extra axis for Income.

```{r}
df %>% 
  e_charts(State) %>% # initialise and set x
  e_line(Population, smooth = TRUE) %>%  # add a line
  e_area(Income, smooth = TRUE, y_index = 1) %>%  # add area
  e_x_axis(name = "States") %>%  # add x axis name
  e_title("US States", "Population & Income") %>%  # Add title & subtitle
  e_theme("infographic") %>%  # theme
  e_legend(right = 0) %>%  # move legend to the bottom
  e_tooltip(trigger = "axis") # tooltip
```

## Navigate options

`echarts4r` is highly customisable, there are too many options to have them all hard-coded in the package but rest assured; they are available, and can be passe to `...`. You will find all these options in the [official documentation](https://ecomfe.github.io/echarts-doc/public/en/option.html).

<a href="https://ecomfe.github.io/echarts-doc/public/en/option.html" class="btn btn-default" target="_blank">

  Official Documentation

For instance the documentation for the tooltip looks like this:

<a href="https://ecomfe.github.io/echarts-doc/public/en/option.html#tooltip" target="_blank">
  <img src="docs.png" class="img-responsive responsive-img" />
</a>

Therefore if we want to change our tooltip to an [axisPointer](https://ecomfe.github.io/echarts-doc/public/en/option.html#tooltip.axisPointer) we can do so by passing a list to `axisPointer`.

```{r}
df %>% 
  e_charts(State) %>% # initialise and set x
  e_line(Population, smooth = TRUE) %>%  # add a line
  e_area(Income, smooth = TRUE) %>%  # add area
  e_x_axis(name = "States") %>%  # add x axis name
  e_title("US States", "Population & Income") %>%  # Add title & subtitle
  e_theme("infographic") %>%  # theme
  e_legend(right = 0) %>% # move legend to the bottom
  e_tooltip(
    axisPointer = list(
      type = "cross"
    )
  ) 
```

Once you come to the realisation that JSON ~= `list` in R, it's pretty easy.
